Unlimitless experiences!
By Anders Jensen and Colby Clarke

This project was made in Spring 2023 for my Multi-Studio I class in the VCU GDES program.

The project uses DALL-E AI created imagery to imagine one example of a 2 input = 1 image output system, with this case using vehicles and fast food restaurants.
